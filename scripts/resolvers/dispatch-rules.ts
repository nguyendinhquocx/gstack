/**
 * {{IMPLEMENTER_DISPATCH_RULES}} — rules for an implementing child agent.
 *
 * docs/designs/HONEST_WORK_GATE_INTEGRITY.md W7. Rendered into /spec's issue
 * body template (the archived spec is the prompt `/spec --execute` pipes to
 * `claude -p`, so the rules travel inside it) and into the /ship Test Coverage
 * Audit (Step 7) test-generation child prompt, before its LAST-line JSON protocol. One
 * constant so the two cannot drift. The child's JSON contracts are untouched:
 * gate-edit disclosure uses the prose the protocols already permit before the
 * JSON line. test/dispatch-rules.test.ts pins the rendering sites.
